# SGPA Average Calculator

Made this for our **HCI practical** using Bootstrap because me and my classmates were busy checking how much SGPA we need next semester to hit a 9 average… or honestly just to see how badly the graph is going sometimes.

You just enter your SGPA for each semester and it shows your average plus a simple line graph that updates as you type. Nothing complicated.

Maybe in the future I’ll integrate this into my **TrackSpace** project.
